Description: SUBSET takes a base prior \pi_0 and tilts it towards a linear subspace via the multiplicative term e^{-\frac{v}{2}\theta'(I-P)\theta}. The user must perform the initial Bayesian inference for this base prior, but afterwards the posterior inference can be adjusted to reflect the exponentially tilted prior.
