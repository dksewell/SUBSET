Description: SUBSET takes a base prior \pi_0 and tilts it towards a linear subspace via the multiplicative term e^{-\frac{v}{2}\theta'(I-P)\theta}. The user must perform the initial Bayesian inference for this base prior, and compute the posterior mean and covariance. *It is imperative that the necessary conditions for an asymptotic normal approximation of the posterior hold for the base prior.*
